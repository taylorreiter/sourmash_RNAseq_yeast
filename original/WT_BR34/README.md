This directory contains files related to WT_BR34. Many interesting files may not be here, as WT_BR34 was primarily used in when four treatments were compared to each other.
Note that the original fastq files and the `trim-low-abund` output files are in .gitignore/original_fastq and .gitignore/khmer_out, respectively, as these were too large to upload.
