This directory contains files related to the analysis of SNF2_BR13 during the benchmarking of sourmash compute/compare with RNAseq reads. 
NB oringal fastq files (downloaded from SRA) and `trim-low-abund` output are in .gitignore/original_fastq and .gitignore/khmer_out, respectively. These files were much too large to push to github.
